Alpha 0.02 - Made an Equivalant Renderer now in 3D, Rotates a Fully 3D Textured Rectangle on the X and Y coordinates. Based of the same code as before but just adapted and changed to render and do the same rotation now in 3D with the same texture also mapped now in 3D.
Alpha 0.01: Renderer and core libraries created, transformation, rotation, texture, 2D object plane, Window Creation, Management and Loop, OpenGL 4.3, GLFW, GLEW, GLM etc. Its open source and can be compiled and used universally via G++ on Windows, MacOS and Linux. Please Download all Files into a single folder, using G++ drag the Main.cpp file onto the terminal and -o Oscillys in your choosen directory prefably in the same folder where your project is. Copy and paste the build .txt for libraries after the -o statement. Make sure to install all required Libaries including GLFW, GLEW, GLM and STB_Image.h according to the methods and guides for each platform. Then Install the first three Dynamically and globally on your system while just installing the STB_image.h file of It's Git Repo and putting in the project folder and leaving the directory of it in its #include header.
